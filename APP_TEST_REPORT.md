## 🎯 **Overall Assessment**

**Score: 75/100** - Strong foundation, needs key missing feature

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Solid technical implementation
- ✅ Smart Fan Pick calculator exists
- ✅ Priority system architecture complete
- ✅ Instagram-style modern UI

**Critical Gap:**
- ❌ **Missing PiggyBong Light Meter** - The signature feature that makes it fan-focused vs budget-focused

**The app has excellent bones and is very close to the agreed vision. The main missing piece is the emotional feedback system (light meter) that transforms it from a budget app to a fan priority planner.**
