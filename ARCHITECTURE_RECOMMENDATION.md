# Recommended Architecture for PiggyBong

## Why Service Layer (Simplified) is Best

### For Your Specific Context:
- **Team Size**: 1-3 developers
- **Sprint Length**: 6 days
- **App Type**: Consumer K-pop budgeting app
- **Complexity**: Moderate (not enterprise-level)

### Recommended Approach: Lightweight Service Layer

Keep service abstraction but remove the over-engineering:

```swift
// Simplified DatabaseService (should be ~150 lines, not 547)
@MainActor
class DatabaseService: ObservableObject {
    @Published var artists: [Artist] = []
    @Published var purchases: [Purchase] = []
    @Published var isLoading = false
    @Published var errorMessage: String?
    
    private let supabase = SupabaseService.shared
    
    // Simple operations without over-engineering
    func fetchArtists() async {
        isLoading = true
        do {
            artists = try await supabase.getArtists()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
        isLoading = false
    }
    
    func addPurchase(_ purchase: Purchase) async {
        // Optimistic UI update
        purchases.append(purchase)
        
        do {
            try await supabase.createPurchase(purchase)
        } catch {
            // Rollback on error
            purchases.removeAll { $0.id == purchase.id }
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
}
```

### What to Keep:
1. **Service layer for testability**
2. **Basic error handling**
3. **Optimistic UI updates**
4. **Clear separation of concerns**

### What to Remove:
1. ❌ Circuit breakers
2. ❌ Batch processing
3. ❌ Complex caching
4. ❌ Rate limiting
5. ❌ Offline sync queues
6. ❌ Performance metrics

### Benefits of This Approach:

#### ✅ **Speed & Simplicity**
- Faster development cycles
- Easy to understand and debug
- New team members can contribute quickly

#### ✅ **Testability**
- Can mock services for unit tests
- Business logic separated from views

#### ✅ **Future-Proof**
- Easy to add features when actually needed
- Can migrate to different backend if required

#### ✅ **Maintainability**
- Clear code structure
- Predictable patterns

## Implementation Steps:

1. **Simplify DatabaseService** (remove scalability features)
2. **Keep BudgetService** (good business logic separation)
3. **Maintain SupabaseService** (clean API wrapper)
4. **Views stay clean** (no direct Supabase calls)

## When to Add Complexity:

Add features **only when you have evidence you need them**:
- Caching: When you see performance issues
- Offline support: When users complain about connectivity
- Circuit breakers: When you have reliability problems

## File Structure Should Be:
```
Services/
├── SupabaseService.swift      (~150 lines - API wrapper)
├── DatabaseService.swift     (~150 lines - simplified)
├── BudgetService.swift       (~120 lines - business logic)
└── AuthManager.swift         (~100 lines - auth logic)
```

**Total: ~520 lines vs current 1000+ lines**

Your current DatabaseService has features for handling millions of users. Build for your actual scale first, then evolve.
