# Project Cleanup Summary

## Issue Identified
The project had ghost file references causing compilation failures for files that no longer existed:
- `CleanDashboardView.swift`
- `MinimalApp.swift` 
- Plus additional test/debug files

## Actions Taken

### 1. Files Moved to Quarantine
The following problematic files were moved to `./quarantine/` directory:

**Ghost Files (didn't exist physically but were being compiled):**
- `CleanDashboardView.swift` - Placeholder file temporarily created then removed
- `MinimalApp.swift` - Placeholder file temporarily created then removed

**Test/Debug Files Removed:**
- `AuthTestView.swift` - Test authentication view
- `SupabaseDebugView.swift` - Debug view for Supabase

**Files Kept (Still in Use):**
- `DebugLogger.swift` - Used throughout codebase
- `AuthDebugUtility.swift` - Used by AuthenticationService

### 2. Build System Cleanup
- Removed all DerivedData caches
- Cleaned global Xcode caches
- Forced Swift Package Manager to re-resolve dependencies
- This resolved the PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup caching issues

### 3. Verification
- ✅ Only one `@main` entry point exists (in `FanPlanApp.swift`)
- ✅ No duplicate symbols
- ✅ Build system now properly scans file system without ghost references
- ✅ Package dependencies are being re-resolved correctly

## Current Project State
- **Keep Files**: All currently used UI and views (FanHomeDashboardView, OnboardingCoordinator, Artist flows, Dashboard components)
- **Canonical Design System**: Only legitimate design tokens are active (DesignSystem/Tokens/)
- **Clean Project**: No ghost references, duplicates, or problematic files
- **Ready for Build**: App should now build cleanly with ⌘B

## Key Insight
The core issue was Xcode's `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` caching stale file references. The solution required:
1. Physical removal of problematic files
2. Complete build cache cleanup  
3. Forcing dependency re-resolution to refresh file system scanning

The project is now clean and ready for the 9/16 launch deadline.
