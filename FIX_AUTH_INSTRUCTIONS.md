# Authentication Fix Instructions

## Current Issue
Apple and Google sign-in buttons show no response or fail silently. The providers are enabled in Supabase but the OAuth credentials are not properly configured.

## Required Fixes

### 1. Google OAuth Configuration
You need to configure Google OAuth in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR-PROJECT-REF/auth/providers)
2. Click on **Google** provider
3. Add these credentials:
   - **Client ID**: `301452889528-rqd96cu7r6gtu46fmvafrdfbhsjn9vq1.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - **Client Secret**: Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
4. Add Authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud Console:
   - `https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### 2. Apple OAuth Configuration
Configure Apple Sign In in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR-PROJECT-REF/auth/providers)
2. Click on **Apple** provider
3. Add these credentials from Apple Developer Portal:
   - **Service ID**: (e.g., `com.piggybong.auth`)
   - **Team ID**: Your Apple Team ID
   - **Key ID**: Your Sign in with Apple Key ID
   - **Private Key**: Your Sign in with Apple private key (.p8 file contents)

### 3. Temporary Workaround
While you configure OAuth providers, users can use **Email Authentication** which is working:
- The "Continue with Email" option is fully functional
- Users can sign up and sign in with email/password

## Verification Steps
After configuring the providers:

1. Test Google Sign-In:
   - Tap "Continue with Google"
   - Should open Google sign-in flow
   - Should return to app authenticated

2. Test Apple Sign-In:
   - Tap "Continue with Apple"
   - Should show Apple ID prompt
   - Should return to app authenticated

## Code Status
✅ The app code is correctly implemented for both providers
✅ The authentication service handles token exchange properly
✅ Supabase connection is working
❌ OAuth provider credentials need to be added in Supabase Dashboard
