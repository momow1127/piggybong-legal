# RevenueCat API Credentials Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem Diagnosis

The PiggyBong app was experiencing RevenueCat API credential issues with the following errors:
- `ERROR: There was a credentials issue. Check the underlying error for more details. Invalid API Key.`
- `WARN: Attempt to update CustomerInfo from network failed.`
- `API request failed: GET '/v1/subscribers/$RCAnonymousID%3A93339750...' (401)`

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis

1. **Invalid API Key**: The app was using `"placeholder-key-for-testing"` instead of a valid RevenueCat API key
2. **Configuration Mismatch**: Multiple RevenueCat manager implementations with inconsistent configuration
3. **Missing Environment Variables**: `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` was not properly set
4. **Secrets Configuration**: `Secrets.swift` was returning placeholder values

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Environment Configuration

**File: `.env`**
```bash
# RevenueCat Configuration
REVENUECAT_API_KEY=appl_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Note: For production, set this environment variable in Xcode Build Settings
# or use Info.plist configuration
```

### 2. Fixed Secrets.swift Configuration

**File: `FanPlan/Secrets.swift`**
- Replaced placeholder API key with valid development key
- Added proper fallback chain: Environment → Info.plist → Development key
- Enhanced error messages for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

**File: `FanPlan/FanPlanApp.swift`**
- Added comprehensive RevenueCat initialization logging
- Implemented connection testing on app startup
- Added detailed error diagnosis for common issues

### 4. Updated Configuration Files

**File: `PiggyBong-New/PiggyBong-App/Core/Services/Config.swift`**
- Added proper RevenueCat configuration with environment variable support
- Updated product IDs to match competition requirements

### 5. Enhanced RevenueCat Manager (PiggyBong-New)

**File: `PiggyBong-New/PiggyBong-App/Core/Services/RevenueCatManager.swift`**
- Improved API key resolution with multiple sources
- Enhanced error handling with specific error type detection
- Added configuration validation
- Better logging and debugging information

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Set in terminal before running Xcode
export REVENUECAT_API_KEY=appl_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Or add to your shell profile (.zshrc, .bash_profile)
echo 'export REVENUECAT_API_KEY=appl_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Option 2: Xcode Environment Variables
1. Open `FanPlan.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Go to Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
3. Select "Run" → "Arguments" → "Environment Variables"
4. Add: `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` = `appl_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

### Option 3: Info.plist Configuration (Production)
1. Add the provided `Info-template.plist` to your Xcode project
2. Set `REVENUECAT_API_KEY` in Build Settings
3. The plist will reference `$(REVENUECAT_API_KEY)` automatically

## 🧪 Testing Verification

Run the configuration test:
```bash
./test-revenuecat-config.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✅ .env file found
✅ REVENUECAT_API_KEY found in .env  
✅ REVENUECAT_API_KEY environment variable is set
✅ Secrets.swift found
✅ Valid development API key configured
```
