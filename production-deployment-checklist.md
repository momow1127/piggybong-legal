ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_buffers = '16MB';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

## 📊 Load Testing & Performance

### API Load Testing
```bash
# Use Artillery.js for comprehensive load testing
npm install -g artillery

# Test user dashboard endpoint
artillery run load-test-dashboard.yml

# Test news feed endpoint  
artillery run load-test-news.yml

# Test real-time subscriptions
artillery run load-test-realtime.yml
```

### Database Performance Testing
```sql
-- Test critical queries under load
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT * FROM get_user_dashboard_optimized('test-user-id');

-- Monitor slow queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Production Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Database migration test
        run: supabase test
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Supabase
        run: |
          supabase link --project-ref ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF }}
          supabase db push
          supabase functions deploy
      - name: Invalidate CDN cache
        run: aws cloudfront create-invalidation
```

## 📱 Mobile App Configuration

### iOS Production Settings
```swift
// PiggyBong iOS Production Config
struct ProductionConfig {
    static let supabaseURL = "https://your-prod-project.supabase.co"
    static let supabaseKey = "your_production_anon_key"
    static let apiVersion = "v1"
    static let cacheMaxAge = 300 // 5 minutes
    static let enableAnalytics = true
    static let enablePushNotifications = true
}
```

### App Store Preparation
- [ ] Update app version and build number
- [ ] Test in-app purchases with RevenueCat production keys
- [ ] Configure push notification certificates
- [ ] Set up App Store Connect metadata
- [ ] Prepare app screenshots and descriptions
- [ ] Test app review and release process

## 🚨 Incident Response Plan

### Escalation Procedures
```

       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Monitor function invocations
SELECT function_name, 
       COUNT(*) as invocations,
       AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration
FROM edge_functions_logs 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY function_name;
```

### Cost Alerts
- [ ] Set up billing alerts at 80% of budget
- [ ] Monitor API usage and rate limiting effectiveness  
- [ ] Track storage growth and implement cleanup policies
- [ ] Monitor bandwidth usage and optimize large payloads

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Validation

### Smoke Tests
```javascript
// Automated post-deployment tests
const smokeTests = [
  {
    name: 'User Authentication',
    test: () => authenticateTestUser(),
    timeout: 5000
  },
  {
    name: 'Artist Search',
    test: () => searchArtist('BTS'),
    timeout: 3000
  },
  {
    name: 'News Feed Load',
    test: () => loadUserNewsFeed(),
    timeout: 5000
  },
  {
    name: 'Purchase Tracking',
    test: () => createTestPurchase(),
    timeout: 3000
  }
];
```

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Verify API response times < 500ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Confirm database query performance within SLA
- [ ] Test real-time features under production load
- [ ] Validate cache hit rates > 80%
- [ ] Check CDN performance and edge locations
